function A = calcstanza(A)
% CALCSTANZA Calculate B and Q/B values for multi-stanza Ecopath groups
%
% A = calcstanza(In)
%
% This function calculates the B and QB values associated with multistanza
% ecopath groups.
%
% A few caveats...
%
% The values calculated by this script do not exactly replicate the values
% one will get using the EwE 6 "Edit multi-stanza" menu.  For the biomass,
% the difference should be very small, and results I think simply due to
% the fact that my calculations are all carried out in double precision,
% while the EwE code uses a mix of single and integer precision.  Although
% Matlab makes it relatively easy to calculate the direct integrals (over
% mortality rate Z and weight w), for consistency I have instead stuck with
% the convention used in EwE to use a monthly discretization.  In tests,
% the percent error between my results and the EwE ones tend to be <0.01%.
%
% However, the error on the consumption rates is a bit higher (in tests,
% 0.005-0.4%), and I haven't quite figured out the source of this yet.  It
% seems a bit high to be just due to the different precisions, or to the
% fact that I use a much more vectorized approach than the original code.
% While the differences are very small, they may make a difference if one
% plans to generate ensembles using this code and then move back to the EwE
% software.  If you do this, I suggest you double-check the balance of the
% model(s) there.
%
% Input variables:
%
%   In: Ecopath input structure.  B and QB of non-leading multi-stanza 
%       groups can be unknown (i.e. NaN).  Must include the optional stanza
%       fields, including 'stanza', 'ageStart', 'stanzadata', and 'vbK'.
%
% Output variables:
%
%   A:  Ecopath input structure, identical to In except that non-leading
%       multi-stanza group B and QB values have been recalculated/filled
%       in.
